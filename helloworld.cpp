int main(){
    std::cout<<"I like pizza!" <<std::endl; //std cout is standard character output and also this is how u display something here and also at present the two lines will be merged we have to end this line so that the next line comes under the next line

    std::cout<<"Its really good!"<<std::endl;//we can use the std::endl or '\n' both does the same task to end the line

    return 0;
